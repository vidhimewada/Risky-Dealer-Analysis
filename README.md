Risky Dealer Analysis

Created a "risky dealer score" that will indicate which dealers are more likely to return an excessive number of vehicles based upon their known dealer characteristics, past purchasing behavior, and purchased vehicle characteristics. A return rate above 10% is considered excessive. The idea is to be able to score each dealer in the known population of buyers so that a buyer whose "risky dealer score" is too high can be prohibited from purchasing a guarantee at the time of vehicle purchase at auction.
